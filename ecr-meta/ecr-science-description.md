### Thermal Statistics Plugin   


#### By: Jeremy Corner   


This plugin was designed to pull data from a thermal camera and calculate different   
statistical values of the image. This is useful for the purpose of seeing what    
meteorological and enviromental parameters can be measured with thermal cameras.    
For example, I started out simple with using the thermal camera to find the temperature    
of the amibient air. I took subsets of the data using masks to look at different parts    
of the image (grass, bareground, trees, etc.). The final results yeiled that measuring    
the trees followed the ambient temperature value at a nearby weather observation station.    
This makes sense as we measure temperature at two meters above the surface instead of    
right on the ground. Now various other weather parameters are being explored such as    
solar iradiance and cloud base temperatures.
